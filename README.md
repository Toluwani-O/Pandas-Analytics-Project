# Analyzing supermarket data across the country - Company XYZ
Exploring and analyzing supermarket data of company xyz across the country and offering valuable insights that can drive strategic decision-making, optimize operations, and enhance the overall customer experience. This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of supermarket data, uncovering patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can lead to improved performance and increased customer satisfaction.

# Project Steps
* Loading the dataset: In this step, I will combine the dataset from each branch (3 branches) into one dataset for easy analysis. Also, write the syntaxes that will read multiple files from the current working directory and export a CSV file after combining. 
* Data Exploration: In this step, I will explore the loaded dataset using some built-in Pandas functions.
* Dealing with DateTime Features: Using the DateTime library in pandas, extracting Features from date & 
  time, and utilizing the unique() and nunique() method on the date and time column.
* Working with Unique Values in Columns
* Aggregation with GroupBy: using Groupby to perform some statistical functions.
* Data Visualization: Using seaborn library to create visualizations
* Standout section: Performing more visualizations that helped  derive more insights from the data.
